# Portfolio Website

This project was built as a portfolio to introduce myself, using React, SCSS and Bulma.
One might argue that React is kind of overkill for a simple, mostly static site like this one, and that is probably right,
I mainly used it as a means to get some more experience with the framework and try out of some of the its features :)

The result can be viewed [here](https://julianeumann.github.io/portfolio/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
